I've been working on some user-specific methods, so you can now use the `trakt.user.*` family of functions to get a user'sâ€¦

* Collection: `trakt.user.collection()`
* Watched items: `trakt.user.watched()`
* Stats: `trakt.user.stats()`

All of them default to the username set in `getOption("trakt.username")`, but any publicly viewable user should work. Note that OAuth2 is not implemented, so private users can't be accessed.

As of today, all the functions are updated to use the new APIv2, except for `trakt.show.stats`,
which is currently not yet implemented at trakt.tv, see [their docs](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/reference/shows/stats/get-show-stats)

Now the package is usable again, and I can continue to work on bug fixes and enhancements. Yay.

I am now trying to migrate everything to the [new trakt.tv APIv2](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/).
Since I mostly don't know what I'm doing, I have to make this up as I go along, but oh well.
Now the search function `trakt.search` should be working fine, as it is the only function
that is tested/built with the new API in mind. Others to come.
