## tRakt News

### v0.8.0

* Added more user-facing functions (`trakt.user.following` / `.followers` / `.friends`) because maybe I want to throw [networkD3](https://github.com/christophergandrud/networkD3) at my people
* Improve consistency with date variables: The `.posix` variables should be removed and the existing date variables should just be properly converted to `POSIXct`
* Improve documentation: Added `@family` tags to all functions to group them together
* Add a package vignette
* Minor fixes and non-breaking additions
* Trying to keep things organized and all I got was this inconsistently header'd NEWS.md

### 2015-02-16

I've been working on some user-specific methods, so you can now use the `trakt.user.*` family of functions to get a user'sâ€¦

* Collection: `trakt.user.collection()`
* Watched items: `trakt.user.watched()`
* Stats: `trakt.user.stats()`

All of them default to the username set in `getOption("trakt.username")`, but any publicly viewable user should work. Note that OAuth2 is not implemented, so private users can't be accessed.

### 2015-02-11

As of today, all the functions are updated to use the new APIv2, except for `trakt.show.stats`,
which is currently not yet implemented at trakt.tv, see [their docs](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/reference/shows/stats/get-show-stats)

Now the package is usable again, and I can continue to work on bug fixes and enhancements. Yay.

### 2015-02-10

I am now trying to migrate everything to the [new trakt.tv APIv2](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/).
Since I mostly don't know what I'm doing, I have to make this up as I go along, but oh well.
Now the search function `trakt.search` should be working fine, as it is the only function
that is tested/built with the new API in mind. Others to come.
