#' Get a show's episode information
#'
#' \code{trakt.getEpisodeData} pulls detailed episode data.
#' Get details for a show's episodes, e.g. ratings, number of votes, 
#' airdates, urls, plot overviewsâ€¦
#' 
#' This is basically just an extension of \link[tRakt]{trakt.show.season}, which is used in 
#' this function to collect all the episode data.
#' If you only want the episode data for a single season anyway, \code{trakt.show.season}
#' is recommended.
#' @param target The \code{slug} of the show requested
#' @param season_nums Vector of season numbers, e.g. \code{c(1, 2)}
#' @param extended Defaults to \code{full,images} to get season posters. Can be 
#' \code{min}, \code{images}, \code{full}, \code{full,images}
#' @param dropunaired If \code{TRUE}, episodes which have not aired yet are dropped.
#' @return A \code{data.frame} containing episode details
#' @export
#' @import plyr
#' @import httr
#' @note This function is mainly for convenience.
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' get_trakt_credentials() # Set required API data/headers
#' breakingbad.episodes <- trakt.getEpisodeData("breaking-bad", c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
#' }
