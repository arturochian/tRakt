#' Get a show's episode information
#'
#' \code{trakt.getEpisodeData2} pulls detailed episode data (differently).
#' Get details for a show's episodes, e.g. ratings, number of votes, 
#' airdates, urls, plot overviewsâ€¦
#' @param target The \code{slug} or \code{tvdbid} of the show requested
#' @param show.seasons Only used for the number of seasons.
#' @param apikey API-key used for the call. 
#' Defaults to \code{getOption("trakt.apikey")}
#' @param dropunaired If \code{TRUE}, episodes which have not aired yet are dropped.
#' @return A \code{data.frame} containing episode details
#' @export
#' @import plyr
#' @import httr
#' @note This function uses much less API calls than \link{trakt.getEpisodeData}.
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' options(trakt.apikey = jsonlite::fromJSON("key.json")$apikey)
#' breakingbad.seasons  <- trakt.getSeasons("breaking-bad")
#' breakingbad.episodes <- trakt.getEpisodeData2("breaking-bad", breakingbad.seasons)
